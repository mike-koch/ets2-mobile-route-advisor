# ETS2 Mobile Route Advisor [![Current Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/mkoch227/ets2-mobile-route-advisor.svg)](https://github.com/mkoch227/ets2-mobile-route-advisor/releases) [![Licensed under the MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mkoch227/ets2-mobile-route-advisor/blob/master/LICENSE)
Euro Truck Simulator 2's Route Advisor, for mobile devices. This is a skin for funbit's [ETS2 Telemetry Web Server](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server).

## Features
The mobile Route Advisor is planned to include all features that Euro Truck Simulator 2's Route Advisor currently has. These features are:
 - Navigation
    - The mini-map will be the most difficult to create, as the Telemtry SDK does not provide any graphical representation of the truck's current position in-game, except for X, Y, and Z coordinates.  These coordinates, unfortunately, have no relationship to latitude / longitude coordinates, nor is the ETS 2 map 100% accurate with real roadways. An ETS2 map has been created by Funbit, who created the ETS2 Telemetry server; however there is no relationship to pixels vs in-game coordinates at this time.
    - Speed limit
    - Distance Remaining
    - Estimated time of arrival (ETA)
    - Time to destination
 - Current job information
    - Current load
    - Destination city
    - Payout
    - Time remaining
    - Time until next rest
 - Truck damage / load damage
 - Localization support
 - [Various configuration options](https://github.com/mkoch227/ets2-mobile-route-advisor/wiki/config.json-Parameters)
